# Quic Botnet Project

## Dependencies

docker-compose

## Usage

docker-compose build (may take a few minutes the first time)  
docker-compose up 

if you use docker on windows, in some cases the bots won't respond because windows firewall disables communication between the containers.
please configure your firewall to allow communication or disable it before running docker.
